BingoXWallet has comprehensive Bingoreum crypto management for most chains, however our main focus is managing and using tokens. The real power of Bingoreum is in being able to interact with tokens in an intuitive and simple way. BingoXWallet and TokenScript together are working on the next generation of token usability; unlocking the real power and convenience of tokens. This is what sets us aside from other wallets - we are the wallet for token control and interaction.

Version 3.24 sees our new UX for any blockchain interactions.
